## General Printing Issues and Its Troubleshooting

### No Paper Error: 

If your printer tray is loaded with pages and still you are confronting No Paper issue, it is possible that an object or paper gets stuck in the rear tray. Hence turn off the printer, detach the cables and clear any existing obstacle from the input tray. Also, clean the paper feed roller by using a wet and clean cloth. You might face this error if the loaded paper is curled or wrinkled, so replace the paper with an appropriate one. Further, the size of the page that you have inserted in the tray must match the paper size settings of the file being printed. These tips will absolutely fix the No Paper error.

### Poor Print Quality Issue: 

When you print a colored or black ink paper, sometimes the printed page consists of too many ink spots, horizontal lines, patches, or faded text. This issue generally appears due to dried ink which can be easily cleared by running the printer’s utility program. The printer will also print unclear pages if the installed cartridges contain a low amount of ink. In that case, swap the ink cartridge with a new one. If the error still persists, you should clean the printheads and then print a page.

### Slow Printer:

There are situations when your printer does not function properly and runs too slowly. The main reason behind this error is setting a high-print quality. Hence, reduce the print settings to improve the performance of your printer. This will also save the cost of extra ink or toner. If the printer is still not operating at a fast speed, place the printer within the router range, and assure that your printer is receiving better Wifi signals.
